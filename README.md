### Develop

```bash
npm i # install dependencies to build tools
./make.coffee dev # build html
```

HTML is generated from `cirru/index.cirru`.
Read that file and you would know what's happening.

## Prupose

Developers should play around with as many languages and ecosystems as possible, I really liked this project because it highlights the familiar which makes it a bit easier to dip your toes into something different.
